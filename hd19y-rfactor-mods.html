Welcome to Hobbo's Helpful Hints where I take the time to explain to you guys how to install mods into rFactor. Some useful sites for downloading I recently came across a Initial D mod for rFactor, but I can't find the download link anywhere, can someone Lista de mods para rFactor. Se descargan, descomprimen y se colocan en la carpeta raíz del juego. Créditos a sus respectivos creadores. I know this probaly has been asked a thousand times before. But what is your favortie I understand that the base game is supposed to be the most realistic sim game next to iracing but how do the mods stack up. Are the more popular ones just skins over cars already in the game? For example, If I download the Toyota Supra thats rated 5/5 in street cars, will it handle as realistic as a real Supra. 
I've converted the F1AL 2016 mod from rFactor but when I load up AMS the cars are way too bright, the Mercedes for example is practically white instead of silver. Has anyone else had this issue and is there a fix? Thanks. Hey folks, so a few weeks ago I got rFactor, mostly for the purpose of installing the FSR mod, which I did. However the mod seems to have just replaced the base-game entirely (none of the normal cars or tracks are there, just FSR stuff). I'm happy with the mod but I'm wondering, how do I get the original stuff back as well as keeping the FSR mod? I was looking at the booklet and a lot of the cars that came with the game interest me. Thanks! Edit: FIXED, for anyone to happens to be reading Hi, I am in a new rFactor modding group and we have many ideas every day of what we COULD make, out only problem is that we don't have anyone who is good at car modelling, we have some people who attempt it but don't have the time or aren't up to rFactor standards. Reply to this post if you are interested in joining. so i have tried installing RallyWorld 4.0 for rFactor but only a fraction of the cars show up and theres no sound for some reason. Any help would be appreciated. I've checked rfactor central but seem to be having some real problems. Anyone recommend any other sites? Thanks. Im trying to get some insight into what you simracing redditors consider to be some of the best rfactor mods that youve come across and why you chose that? I myself havent tried a lot of different ones so itll give me a good idea about whats out there and whats tried and tested. Im not limiting this to any particular category of racing. Bring em all. PS: Also if there is anyone new getting into rfactor or simracing in general 
What title got you into Simracing? What did you like/dislike about it? Where did you go on from there to end up playing the Simracing titles you do today? I'd be cool to know when how everyone got into simracing. Here is mine: My SimRacing Journey started on Oval the more I think about it. I started with Nascar Thunder 2004 and Nascar SimRacing both on PC (not really sim but Simcade) with my Red Logitech Wingman (yep on a wheel with my booster chair at 4!). Now I wish my dad had gotten. Open the website, stop having it be closed. Please, after the fall of NoGripRacing, you got to open the site up, you're basically the last place left with any good rfactor mods. Also, Please unban me, all I wanted was help with the EnduRacers Classics mods. Sincerely, umatbru In case anyone doesn't know what F1classic is: http://f1classic.your-talk.com/. Seems like a way easier method to install mods then using a third party mod installer and going through that. For how old the game is I don't get it. rFactor makes As I was perusing the internet recently, just browsing all things sim racing related, I came across a website for a sim called Simraceway. I've been pretty active on this sub for about the last 2 years and don't remember hearing anything about this game, maybe if I did I thought it was an rfactor mod or something. After doing a quick search I found a couple threads from 2+ years ago saying maybe the game ran into some financial or legal trouble and shut down? I was just wondering if anyone. Post your suggestion or vote up an existing answer. Hi Guys I was wondering if you guys could point me in the right direction. What PC sim can I use to race the first gen Daytona Prototype (ie not the Corvette DP but the ones before that)? I ask because I am having trouble finding anything as I am getting a lot of search results for the DPi and the Corvette DP. Thank. 
Are there any games that still have an active multiplayer? Was looking forward in playing some actual racing sims after messing around in GTA V. Preferably something with a low price, but any recommendations is fine. Thanks. For anybody who played score or wcorr reloaded, or is a fan off off road racing in general this is a must try. The physics update to this version is a real game changer. Not to mention the 4 or 5 new classes and the multitude of tracks. This is one of the top rfactor mods IMO. Maybe even number 1.
